# Templates

drawDB comes with a few built-in templates that you can "fork" to either build on or just explore the app. 

Additionally you can define your own templates and load them whenever you're creating a new diagram. This can help you define reusabe componenets to later build on.

<ThemedImage lightImageSrc={require("./img/light/templates.png").default} darkImageSrc={require("./img/dark/templates.png").default} alt="New File" />
